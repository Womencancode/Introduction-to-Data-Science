<This pie chart tells us that out of all the MADE shots during the 2018-19 NBA season, 47% of the makes were layups, 42% of the makes were jumpers, 6% of the makes were floaters(in between a jumper and a layup), 5% of the makes were post shots, and 0% of the makes were heaves. This analysis is expected because layups are attempted closest to the basket and thus have the highest percentage of going in. On the other hand, no heaves were made at all because they are desperation shots attempted extremely far from the basket(usually when the clock is winding down), thus making them nearly impossible to make.>
