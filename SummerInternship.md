## Data Exploration
<1-3 setences of what the goal was>

### Cleaning the Data
<First we identified 6 variables from the "messy" dataset that we thought were good predictors of scoring success (shot_clock, shot_type, three, fouled, distance, outcome); next, we isolated those columns of data in a separate dataframe. In order to contextualize the x and y coordinates that at first sight seemed like a jumble of numbers, we applied the .loc function to split the court into 4 general areas: left, right, center, and 3-pt territory; we applied the same .loc function to the shot clock column in order to categorize each shot taken as either a desperate shot, a standard shot, or a rushed shot. With our 8 variables placed in a new dataframe, we were then able to create graphs etc... to analyze the data.>
